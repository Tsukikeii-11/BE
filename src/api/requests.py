"""
This module is intended for defining request models or data transfer objects (DTOs)
if a more structured approach is needed beyond what Marshmallow schemas provide.
For this project, Marshmallow schemas handle input validation and parsing,
so this file can remain minimal or be used for more complex, cross-cutting request logic.
"""
# Currently, this file is empty as schemas handle the request data.
# You can add custom request classes here if your project grows.

"""
This module can be used for centralized route management.
However, since Flask-RESTX handles route registration directly
within the controllers, this file can be kept empty to avoid redundancy.
All route definitions are located in the respective controller files
within the 'src/api/controllers' directory.
"""
# No routes are defined here.
